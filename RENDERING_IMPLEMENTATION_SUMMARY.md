- **Free Roam** - Full 6DOF camera control with mouse and keyboard

**Features:**
- Smooth transitions between camera modes
- Mouse and keyboard input handling
- Zoom controls via mouse wheel
- Vehicle tracking and following
- Configurable camera parameters (FOV, near/far planes)
- Performance-optimized matrix calculations
- Constraint system to prevent invalid camera states

**Controls:**
- Mouse movement for camera rotation (free roam and third person)
