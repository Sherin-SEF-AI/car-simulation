AutoSim Pro is a comprehensive autonomous vehicle simulation platform designed for researchers, engineers, and developers working on self-driving car technologies. The platform provides realistic vehicle physics, advanced AI behavioral modeling, and professional-grade analytics tools for testing and validating autonomous driving algorithms.

Built with modern Python technologies and featuring a professional Qt6 interface, AutoSim Pro offers the depth and flexibility needed for serious autonomous vehicle research while remaining accessible to educational users and hobbyists.

## Key Features

### Advanced AI and Machine Learning
AutoSim Pro incorporates sophisticated artificial intelligence systems that enable realistic autonomous vehicle behavior. The platform supports multiple AI approaches including neural networks, reinforcement learning, and behavioral cloning. Users can configure six different levels of vehicle autonomy following SAE J3016 standards, from manual control to full automation.

The AI system includes decision trees and state machines for complex behavioral modeling, allowing researchers to test various driving scenarios and edge cases that autonomous vehicles might encounter in real-world conditions.

### Realistic Vehicle Physics
The simulation engine operates at 120Hz to provide accurate vehicle dynamics modeling. The platform supports simultaneous simulation of over 50 vehicles across seven different vehicle types: sedans, SUVs, trucks, sports cars, buses, motorcycles, and emergency vehicles.

Vehicle physics include advanced tire modeling using the Pacejka tire model with slip calculations, realistic suspension dynamics, and environmental effects that impact vehicle performance. This level of detail enables accurate testing of vehicle control algorithms under various conditions.

### Professional Analytics and Reporting
AutoSim Pro provides comprehensive data analysis tools including real-time dashboards with live performance metrics and KPIs. The analytics system features interactive visualizations, customizable charts, and professional reporting capabilities.

Data can be exported in multiple formats including CSV and JSON for further analysis. The platform includes performance profiling tools to help optimize simulation parameters and identify system bottlenecks.

### Dynamic Environment System
The platform simulates various environmental conditions including weather effects such as rain, snow, fog, and wind. Dynamic lighting changes throughout the day affect visibility and vehicle sensor performance, providing realistic testing conditions.

The traffic management system includes intelligent traffic lights, pedestrian crossing systems, and multiple road surface types with realistic friction coefficients. These features enable comprehensive testing of autonomous vehicle systems under diverse conditions.

### Professional User Interface
Built with Qt6, the interface provides a modern, responsive design with dockable panels that can be customized for different workflows. The 3D visualization system uses OpenGL for real-time rendering of the simulation environment.

The interface supports multi-monitor setups for professional use cases and includes comprehensive control panels for managing all aspects of the simulation.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher (Python 3.10+ recommended for optimal performance)
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB+ recommended for large-scale simulations)
- Graphics card with OpenGL 3.3+ support for 3D visualization
- Operating System: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)

### Installation

The recommended installation method uses the automated setup script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sherin-SEF-AI/car-simulation.git
cd car-simulation
python setup_complete.py
```

For manual installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sherin-SEF-AI/car-simulation.git
cd car-simulation
pip install -r requirements_complete.txt
python main_ultra_advanced.py
```

### Initial Setup
After installation, launch AutoSim Pro and familiarize yourself with the interface layout. The left panel contains vehicle spawning controls, while the right panel provides environment and simulation settings. Use the bottom panel to monitor active vehicles and their status.

To begin your first simulation, spawn a few vehicles using the controls in the left panel, then press F5 to start the simulation. Press F9 to access the comprehensive analytics dashboard for real-time monitoring and data analysis.
